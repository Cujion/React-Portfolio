## Description
* This application is a single page React application. With this application you learn how to build a react front end app from scratch. You will leverage a ton of different concepts which include, how to render different html page layout files in order to be able change pages without reloading the entire page each time. another concept used is event handling, for example when viewing on smaller screen sizes the navbar tabs will turn into a hamburger icon which you can then click on to display a sidenav in order to be able to switch between each of the pages. This application is used to display and about me page which consists of an profile picture and a short description, a portfolio page which displays 6 different projects. We also have a contact me form submission and finally a resume page which has an icon at the bottom that can be clicked on to be directed to a google doc pdf file of my resume.
